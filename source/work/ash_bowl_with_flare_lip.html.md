description: "This very unique bowl with a bell shape at the rim has many special features. Made from ash wood, it is rather large, approximately 20 inches across and 7-8 inches deep. Very interesting grain patterns occur throughout the bowl. A naturally occurring crack allowed further unusual enhancement with turquoise filler that stretches down the side of the bowl. Definite conversation piece that could double as a big family salad bowl."
