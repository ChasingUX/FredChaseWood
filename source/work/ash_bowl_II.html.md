description: "This ash wood very large country style salad bowl of over 21 inches in diameter and about 9 inches in depth is gorgeous. With a food safe tung oil finish, it offers a very dramatic statement to any dining, kitchen, or large coffee table. The grain is full of swirls, and it's a delight to hold. This highly unique bowl rarely comes along, but mother nature brought down a very old tree and its life continues in this form for the interested collector."
